## About Me

Hello! My name is Kseniya.  
I live in Novi Sad, Serbia.

Transitioning into IT was a long-considered decision, and once I took the step, I fully committed to developing in **software testing**, particularly in **test automation**.

My previous experience in sales provided me with valuable skills, such as **working with large datasets**, **quickly adapting to new tools and systems** (1C, CRM, Bitrix), and **handling technical documentation**. I developed strong problem-solving abilities, the capacity to work under tight deadlines, and effective communication skills for collaboration across teams and partner organizations.

Currently, I focus on **UI automation testing**, particularly in projects where automation needs to be built from scratch. I enjoy **designing test frameworks, writing automated test cases, and improving test coverage**. I have experience in **manual and automated testing**, **API testing using Postman**, **database validation with SQL**, and working with **test management tools like Jira and TestRail**. My technical stack includes **Java (Selenium, Selenide)**, and I am eager to expand my expertise in **Kotlin, Python, and JavaScript (basics)**.

While I am not yet an expert in CI/CD setup, I understand its importance and have experience integrating automated tests into existing pipelines.

I am passionate about continuous learning and growth in the field of software testing. My goal is to contribute to high-quality software delivery and be part of **a team that values efficiency, automation, and quality assurance from the ground up**.

I look forward to the opportunity to apply my skills and grow as a **QA Automation Engineer**.

## Key Skills

* **Manual Testing:** Functional, UI/UX, regression, and exploratory testing of web applications
* **Test Design & Documentation:** Writing test cases, checklists, and test plans based on requirements
* **Testing Theories & Methodologies:** Applying modern testing strategies, risk-based testing, and defect classification
* **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) & Testing Life Cycle (STLC):** Understanding of development and testing processes within Agile frameworks
* **Automation Testing:** Writing and executing automated test scripts for UI and API testing
* **Programming & Scripting:** Java (OOP principles, automation frameworks), Selenium, Selenide
* **API Testing:** Working with REST APIs using Postman and automated API validation
* **Database Testing:** Writing and executing SQL queries for data verification and integrity checks
* **Performance Testing:** Basic understanding of load and stress testing principles
* **Version Control Systems:** Working with Git, GitLab (branching, merging, pull requests)
* **Defect Management:** Tracking and reporting bugs using Jira, TestRail, and other test management tools
* **Browser Developer Tools:** Debugging and inspecting UI elements, network requests, and console logs
* **Collaboration & Agile Workflows:** Experience in cross-functional team collaboration, participating in daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives
