## QA Engeneer

Hello! My name is Kseniya. 
I am taking retraining courses for autotesting in Netology (link). The deadline is in March 2024. I have been self-studying since June 2022. But it was necessary to somehow systematize the information and sort it out. To do this, I turned to Netology. I studied manual testing myself, plus a full course on manual testing in Netology will be completed in February 2023. I can create test cases, test suites, checklists, create bugs in Jira. I’ve practiced in Postman, I know the basics of MySQL, as well as the basics of HTML layout. Now I'm familiar with Git and GitHub. I also go through the basics of Python in parallel. Later there will be JS (basics). At the same time, I improve my level of spoken English.

## Key skills

•	Use of actual testing theories
•	Understanding of software development life cycle
•	Creating checklists, test-cases, test-suites
